# Original repository

On the night of 2025, May 15th, I was trying to generate this repository, but it was completely stuck generating. I couldn't delete or rename the repository, so I created another one with `-1` appended to it. I was considering it my "repository that is infinitely generating" although it was created by the time I woke up. I could have deleted this repository after it generated, but I didn't want to, as it took so long to generate, and was historical for this reason. On 2025, May 16th, this repository was renamed from `Gurgle_Orcut_Docs-1` to `Gurgle_Orcut_Docs-2` then renamed `Gurgle_Orcut_Docs` to `Gurgle_Orcut_Docs-1` before finally renaming this repository to `Gurgle_Orcut_Docs` before archiving `Gurgle_Orcut_Docs-1` it can now be founded [:octocat: `here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Gurgle_Orcut_Docs-1/)
